Python exercises on file handling, user input, and error management – UBA's Computational Thinking Guide 5

# Python File Handling Exercises  
University of Buenos Aires – Introduction to Computational Thinking

This repository contains my solutions for Guide 5 from the course *Introduction to Computational Thinking* at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

## Topics Covered

- Console input and output
- File reading and writing (text files)
- Try-except blocks and exception management
- User input validation
- Data processing from external sources

Each exercise includes the original instruction as a comment in the `GUIA5.py` file.

## Personal Note

This project is part of my programming practice as a Computer Engineering student at UBA.  
I'm working on building strong Python fundamentals while preparing for future challenges like LeetCode and real-world applications.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the file `GUIA5.py`.
2. Open it with a Python-compatible editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
3. Each function is self-contained and can be tested independently.
4. For file-based exercises, sample `.txt` files should be created manually as needed.
